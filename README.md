# Getting Started with Create React App

Music tinder is an application that hopes to connect musicians


My assessment of the application:
1. I think many improvements can be made on the backend. I would like to organize my data much better so that I can completely seperate concerns on the front end. This would also make state
    management much clearer and easier
2. I also want to improve my undestanding of the component lifecycle. 

Future features
1. Right now there is no algorithm that will present more likely matches. Obviously developing this feature would be really cool. Right now being that it is a smaller and theoretically
niche application that would attract a similiar user base, there is no need.
    a. Along the above lines, full Spotify integration would allow users to have a better understanding of each other's tastes
2. Instagram integration. Instagram is huge for musicians to market themeselves and is one of the most widely used networking services. Integrating 
it directly into the app would be a huge plus
3. UI animation
